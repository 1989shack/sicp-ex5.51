# A SICP Scheme Specification

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is a computer science textbook by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It is known as the Wizard Book in hacker culture.  It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.

The MIT Press published the first edition in 1985, and the second edition in 1996. It was formerly used as the textbook for MIT's introductory course in electrical engineering and computer science. SICP focuses on discovering general patterns for solving specific problems, and building software systems that make use of those patterns.

The book uses the programming language Scheme, or more precisely it uses a Scheme, as Scheme has many implementations and dialects.  Also, as the book is about general principals and not specifically about learning Scheme, it only uses a subset of the language.

This specification is an attempt to specify that subset of Scheme that is used in the book.  It may be of use to anyone attempting the book's last two exercises which are to "Develop a rudimentary implementation of Scheme" and who wish to create an implementation which is consistent with the book.

When the second edition was published in 1996 the then current Scheme standard was R4RS, published in 1991.  Therefore, large parts of this document are taken from R4RS.  But many behaviours are explicitily unspecified by that standard - because it described what was common to many Schemes, while recognising how they could differ.  So in addition to the R4RS text there is an attempt to specify what those unspecified behaviours are for SICP scheme - either by refrence to the SICP book or by reference to contemporary MIT Scheme which is it's direct descendant.
